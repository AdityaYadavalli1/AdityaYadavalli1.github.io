Thanks to [Maruan](https://maruan.alshedivat.com) for creating this wonderful template

## Notes to myself
- Must push all the changes to the `source` branch. `master` is for deployment only.
- To deploy a non-github page use the following command:
```
./bin/deploy --user
```
- To deploy to a github page use the following command:
```
./bin/deploy
```
- Use `gh-pages` branch to deploy github pages

- To build this locally use the following command:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
