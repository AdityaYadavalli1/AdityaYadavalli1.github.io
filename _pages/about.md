<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I am a Speech/NLP Engineer at Karya Inc. Here, I work on data processing pipelines, quality estimation of crowdsourced datasets, and building assistive tools for crowdsource workers.

Previously, I was a dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in), where I pursued B.Tech. (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. For my M.S. thesis, I explored how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) with [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/).

<!-- I am a 5th year dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) pursuing a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. I will be (hope to!) graduating in July.

Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in low-resource NLP. As part of my Masters, I am exploring how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) under the guidance of [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/). -->

When not at work, you can find me discussing cricket or picking up obscure trivia that no one cares about.
