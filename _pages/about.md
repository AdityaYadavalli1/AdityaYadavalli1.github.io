I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the LeM🍋N Lab at UC San Diego, where I am advised by [Prof. Alex Warstadt](http://alexwarstadt.github.io). Here, I work on using spoken language models (SLMs) as cognitive models to study how information is conveyed through lexical (textual) and non-lexical (speech) streams of human communication. 

<!-- I am a Speech/NLP Engineer at Karya. Here, I work on data processing pipelines, quality estimation of crowdsourced datasets, and building assistive tools for crowdsource workers. -->

<!-- I also collaborate with [Prof. Alex Warstadt](http://alexwarstadt.github.io) on using language models as cognitive models to understand the amount, distribution, and the kind of information conveyed through different streams of human communication, i.e, speech and text.  -->

Previously, I was a Speech/NLP Engineer at [Karya](https://www.karya.in/). There, I worked on a range of topics: human-LLM agreement across various tasks, building indigenous/endangered language resources, quality estimation of crowdsourced datasets, and assistive tools for crowdsource workers.

I used to volunteer at [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io) to explore how current SLMs do not generalise well, especially when we encounter African languages and accents, and how we can make them better.

<!-- In my free time, I volunteer at [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io) -- a group dedicated to work on improving NLP models for Africa. Along with the rest in the group, I explore how current NLP models do not generalise well, especially when we encounter African languages and accents, and how we can make them better. -->

From 2021-2023, I was also a visiting researcher at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). There, I collaborated with [Prof. Vera Tobin](https://veratobin.org) to evaluate NLP models trained on Child Directed Speech (CDS) to establish common mistakes that humans and NLP models make when acquiring a new (second) language.

I completed my B.Tech. (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in). For my M.S. thesis, I explored how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) with [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/).

<!-- I am a 5th year dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) pursuing a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. I will be (hope to!) graduating in July.

Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in low-resource NLP. As part of my Masters, I am exploring how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) under the guidance of [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/). -->

When not at work, you can find me discussing cricket or picking up obscure trivia that no one cares about.
