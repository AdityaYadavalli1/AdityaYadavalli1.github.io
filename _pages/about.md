<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am a Speech/NLP Engineer at Karya. Here, I work on data processing pipelines, quality estimation of crowdsourced datasets, and building assistive tools for crowdsource workers.

I also collaborate with [Prof. Alex Warstadt](http://alexwarstadt.github.io) on using language models as cognitive models to understand the amount, distribution, and the kind of information conveyed through different streams of human communication, i.e, speech and text. 

In my free time, I volunteer at [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io) -- a group dedicated to work on improving NLP models for Africa. Along with the rest in the group, I explore how current NLP models do not generalise well, especially when we encounter African languages and accents, and how we can make them better.

Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), where I collaborated with [Prof. Vera Tobin](https://veratobin.org). There, I worked on evaluating NLP models trained on Child Directed Speech (CDS) and was looking to establish common mistakes that humans and NLP models make when acquiring a new language.

Even before that, I was a dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in), where I pursued B.Tech. (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. For my M.S. thesis, I explored how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) with [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/).

<!-- I am a 5th year dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) pursuing a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. I will be (hope to!) graduating in July.

Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in low-resource NLP. As part of my Masters, I am exploring how closely related languages can be used to improve the performance of low-resource languages at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) under the guidance of [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/). -->

When not at work, you can find me discussing cricket or picking up obscure trivia that no one cares about.
