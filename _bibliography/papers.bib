abstract = {Dementia is a syndrome chronic or progressive that usually affects the cognitive functioning of the subjects. Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia. One of the many symptoms of Alzheimer’s Dementia is the inability to speak and understand language clearly. The last decade has seen a surge in the research done in Alzheimer’s Dementia detection using Linguistics and acoustic features. This paper takes up the Alzheimer’s Dementia classification task of ADReSS INTERSPEECH-2020 challenge, ”Alzheimer’s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech: The ADReSS Challenge”. It uses eight different acoustic features to find the attributes in the human speech production system (vocal track and excitation source) affected by Alzheimer’s Dementia. In this study, the Alzheimer’s dementia classification is performed using five different Machine Learning models using ADReSS INTERSPEECH-2020 challenge dataset. Since most of the studies in the previous literature have used linguistic features successfully for Alzheimer’s dementia classification, the current study also demonstrates the performance of the BERT model for the dementia classification task. The maximum accuracy obtained by the acoustic feature is 64.5\%, and the BERT Model provides a classification accuracy of 79.1\% over the test dataset. Finally, the score-level fusion of the acoustic model with the BERT Model shows an improvement of 6.1\% classification accuracy over the BERT Model, which indicates the complementary nature of acoustic features to linguistic features.},
