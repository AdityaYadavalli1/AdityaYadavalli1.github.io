I am a 5th year dual degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) pursuing a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & M.S. by Research in Computational Linguistics. I will be (hope to!) graduating in July 2022.

Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in low-resource NLP. As part of my Masters, I am working on **multilingual speech recognition** to improve the performance of **low-resource Indic languages** at Speech Processing Lab (SPL) under the guidance of [Prof. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/anilvuppala/). 

<!-- If you want to discuss any NLP project, do not hesitate to contact me!  -->

When not in the lab, you can find me discussing cricket or picking up obscure trivia that no one cares about. 

 <!-- However, if you want to talk about cricket, please do not contact me. I have, over the years, realised that I have no self-control and miss all my deadlines talking about it.  -->
